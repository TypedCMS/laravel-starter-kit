# TypedCMS Starter Kit for Laravel

Our stater kits are tailored solutions for each platform, unlike the simple API 
wrappers offered by other vendors. The [TypedCMS](https://typedcms.com) starter 
kit for Laravel provides Eloquent like models, repositories, query caching and a 
simple mechanism for adding custom webhook controllers and handlers.

This starter kit wouldn't be possible without the hard work of the many open 
source package developers and contributors on which it is built.

## Installation & Usage Instructions
